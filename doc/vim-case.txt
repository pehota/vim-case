Quickly switch cases between different code cases.
Supported cases are
	- snake_case
	- camelCase
	- kebap-case

Values for {case} in the key mappings are:
	- snake - snake case
	- camel - camel case
	- kebab - kamel case

Example
:CaseSwitch camel

The plugin comes with the following pre-defined mappings available in normal and visual modes (nmap, xmap, vmap):
<localleader>c - convert to camel case
<localleader>s - convert to snake case
<localleader>k - convert to kebab case

All mappings can be overridden by the user by mapping the following commands:

<Plug>CaseSwitchCamel
	Switch to camel case

<Plug>CaseSwitchSnake
	Switch to snake case

<Plug>CaseSwitchKebab
	Switch to kebab case
